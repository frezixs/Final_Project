# Provisional Machine Learning Model
## Overview:
  - Model Chosen
     - We will use Linear Regression Model to predict the housing price.
  - Traninig the Model
     - total price is assigned to y.
     - the remainings are assigned to X.
     - The model is trained with the provisional dataset with (X,y).
  - Model Accuracy
     - The model accuracy is 0.5786.
  - How the model work
     - When the predicted output is continuous (such as housing price), it is recommanded to use linear regression to perform the prediction.
