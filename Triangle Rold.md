# Triangle Role

## The Process of Database
- At first, we did the web scraping for our data. There are two different types, deal and selling. We could compare them to see real price and list.
- Secondly, we did the data cleaning for all data and connect the PgAdmin directly, using 'to sql'.
- Thirdly, we used the PgAdmin to merge the tables, then export the final data as csv file.
- Fourthly, we used the SQliteStudio to create our database, import csv file. We saved database locally and everyone had the same file.
- Moreover, we also used google map javascript API to create map.
- Finaly, we opened the database for our Machine Learning.
